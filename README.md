## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - JS library
- [Sweet alert 2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) - Popup


### Continued development

I would like to improve in many aspects of design and programming logic, grid handling in a responsive way. In addition to making many projects of giant size to learn more every day from other developers and improve the quality of code.
